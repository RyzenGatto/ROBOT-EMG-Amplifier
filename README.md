# ROBOT-EMG-Amplifier
This circuit is part of a research project. It takes EMG signals and amplifies them to be read by a microcontroller.

## Information

This device is cheap to reproduce, can be hand-soldered, is breadboard compatible, and is safe to the user when used with a battery in a closed circuit. 

The design has been validated on LTSpice and PSpice but is awaiting physical confirmation.
